    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{q1/itr_0_predictions_run0}

    A small network is used.
    Results can be improved using a larger network.

    \subsection*{Second Run}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{q1/itr_0_predictions_run1}

    Small number of iterations are used.
    Results can be improved by increasing iteration count.
    MPE is the worst.

    \subsection*{Third Run}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{q1/itr_0_predictions_run2}

    Best results are obtained using a larger network and more iterations.
    MPE is the best.

    \section*{Problem 2}

    Train AverageReturn is expected to be around -160 and Eval AverageReturn is expected to be around -70 to -50.
